# Maven-Analysis


I took a deep dive into visualizing the performance of products within the Maven Market. This allowed me to take a different view to my analysis by utilizing measures to draw insights rather than the usual which did not give all the insights clearly. All my measures are recorded in my measures table for easier retrieval. 


The Final Dashboard


This showcases the final output of my visualization. The matrix was generated with my top 30 products sold, the map showing the 3 major markets that the business is focused on, which can be drilled down to various states and cities for further analysis. 
Additionally, it captures the very essential KPIs, the tree map, the charts, the gauge, and the filters applied to them.
Finally, some bookmarks are also included to capture the required information.

The Matrix


The Matrix shows the top 30 product brands with their total transactions, total profits, profit margin, and the return rate of the products between the years 1997 and 1998. The Total transactions are colour coded from the most transacted to the least transacted products. This is shown by the data bars.

Additionally, the Profit margin and the return rates are colour coded as well, with the background colors: White to green for the profit margin, with green being the highest where whereas the return rate is white to red, with red being the highest rate. The lower the return rate, the better.

The KPIs


The very essential KPIs: 

This includes the current month transactions, the current month profits, and the current month returns. The KPIs are visualized against their previous month's targets, with the smaller graphs within them showing the trend taken from the previous month. They also capture the deviation, either positive or negative growth from the previous month s  values. This shows a clear trend in the business direction.

Note that these are arrived at using the measures created and stored in the measures table of my dataset.
